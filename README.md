# MythGen
A collection of random generators for story and plot inspiration.

## Plot Generators
**Plot Builder (index).** An amalgamation of (and improvement on) the Fetch Quest, Adventure, NPC Builder, and Rumor generators. It features a customizable control panel, and draws from a total of 35 possible prompts across all options.

**Fetch Quest.** Generates the basic structue of a fetch quest. This is one of the first generators I built for this project, based on an adaptation of the Querent's Quest spread from the [Magician's Hand of Fate](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11EPCm7Y1JkJE5KiE4GFmvRg2WCJSXt7QJaGUtM-MOLQ/edit?usp=sharing) (another one of my ongoing projects). This generator utilizes 2 prompts and 4 variables.

**Adventure.** A more robust version of the Fetch Quest generator, this time based on the [Adventure Seed Generator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gaqvIaul5iXTfz3gNfVeOmxDeyU6Lrx_ChLytQqUCFY/edit?usp=sharing) by Johnn Four. This generator utilizes 4 prompts, and roughly 22 total variables.

**Rumors.** Creates random rumors that can be used as plot hooks. Based on the [Rumor Maker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RdHh02oIDYTNn1EfKeqVYAiwShdV1Ijxp-4k6MXGcGY/edit?usp=sharing) by Andrew Warzocha. This generator utilizes 11 prompts and roughly 18 total variables.

## Character Generators
**NPC Builder.** Creates basic descriptions for anywhere between one and three NPC characters at a time. Based on Reedsy's [Fantasy Plot Generator](https://blog.reedsy.com/plot-generator/fantasy/). This generator utilizes 15 prompts and roughly 8 total variables.

**Names.** Puts random syllables together to create random fantasy-sounding names, based on a [B/X D&D](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic) Name Generator. Each of these syllables was collected from a proper name from the B/X Rulebooks and B/X modules, or was from the name of an early D&D author. I have also added some of my own. This generator utilizes over 500 syllables.
